It is important to note that a generated alert does not necessarily indicate potential malicious activity, but rather serve as means for awareness and continuous monitoring. Please note: This analytic only looks at anomalies that have been fine-tuned. To adjust threshold/sensitivity levels, you will need to modify the individual anomaly rule that is in place. \n//Author(s): Ginna Woo \u0026 Edward Jiang\n//False Positives: None\nAnomalies\n| where AnomalyTemplateName contains \"customized\"\n//Excluding these Anomalies as we are testing these at moment - GWoo 8/23\n| where AnomalyTemplateName  in  (\"UEBA Anomalous Account Access Removal - Customized\", \"UEBA Anomalous Defensive Mechanism Modification - Customized\", \"UEBA Anomalous Privilege Granted - Customized\", \"UEBA Anomalous Account Creation - Customized\", \"Anomalous user activities in Office Exchange - Customized\", \"Potential data staging - Customized\", \"Anomalous user/app activities in Azure audit logs - Customized\", \"Anomalous Azure operations\")\n| mv-expand AnomalyReasons\n| where AnomalyReasons.IsAnomalous == \u0027true\u0027\n| evaluate bag_unpack(ActivityInsights)\n| evaluate bag_unpack(UserInsights)\n| evaluate bag_unpack(DeviceInsights)\n| extend AnomalyReasons = bag_remove_keys(AnomalyReasons, dynamic([\"Type\", \"TypicalObservations\", \"Value\"]))\n| summarize Reasons = make_list(AnomalyReasons, 50), AnomalyDetails = any(AnomalyDetails), Entities = any(Entities), ExtendedLinks = any(ExtendedLinks) by UserPrincipalName, TimeGenerated, AnomalyTemplateName, Description, Score, Tactics,Techniques\n| project-reorder TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, AnomalyTemplateName, Description, Score, Reasons",
